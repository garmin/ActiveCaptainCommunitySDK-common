# ActiveCaptain Community SDK - Common
The ActiveCaptain Community SDK contains functions for storing and rendering data from a SQLite database exported from [ActiveCaptain Community](https://activecaptain.garmin.com).

This repository is referenced as a submodule in both the [Android](https://github.com/garmin/ActiveCaptainCommunitySDK-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/garmin/ActiveCaptainCommunitySDK-iOS) repositories, and contains code built natively on both platforms.
